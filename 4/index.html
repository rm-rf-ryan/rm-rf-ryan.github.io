            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p> In the first part of this project I project images via homography transformations to each other and apply multi-resolution blending in order to create panoramas out of separate photos. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Mandatory Linear Algebra</h2>
            <p> Given 2 images and sets of correspondence points p' and p, we want to compute the homography matrix H such that  p'=Hp. We can then apply H to the original image to get the transformed image, although for practical purposes it's better to perform an inverse warp by applying H^{-1} to points in the output and interpolating with pixels from the original image. A homography matrix has 8 degrees of freedom, which requires 4 point correspondences to specify fully. In practice, using only 4 points is a bit unreliable, so I opt to use ~8-20 points and use least squares to solve for the homography matrix </p>
            <p> The homography transform is given by the following, with x and y being points within the original image and x' and y' being points within the image warped by the homography:</p>
            <img src="./media/homography.png" alt="homography.png" class="center">
            <p> In order to solve this system via least squares, through a lot of algebra we can rewrite this in the form Ah=b, where A is a matrix, b, are a vector of the stacked output points, and h is a vector of the coefficients of the homography matrix we want to solve for. w is explicitly given as gx+hy+1 from the formula above, however in practice when we warp using homographies we can just normalize by the z component (dividing the transformed x and y coordinates by w to get the true x' and y'). For multiple correspondence points, we stack the additional rows to the b vector and A matrix as pictured. </p>

            <h2>Image Rectification</h2>
            <p> I test the efficacy of my homography warp finding code by finding a quadrilateral (which would normally appear as a rectangle when viewed from straight on) within an image transforming it to be a rectangle. This has the effect of warping the images so that they appear to be viewed from straighter on</p>
            <p> In order to warp the images, I compute the inverse of the affine transformation matrix between each triangle in the original image and the corresponding triangle in the average shape. I then perform inverse warping with this matrix, performing bilinear interpolation in the case that the inverse transformation warps values between pixels, and iterate over all triangles to produce the warped image. </p>

            The second example cannot be projected to a true rectangle because of its 3D geometry, although it is close to one and we can see that our homography transformation still does a good job of rectifying it.

            <h2>Panoramal Activity</h2>
            <p> Now with a working homography finder, we can warp feature points between images so that they all are aligned on the same imaging plane. For now, these feature points are manually selected. In order to align these images, I take the difference between the centroids of the feature points of each image to find the relevant translation, and do some geometry to find what the final output image size should be. The last step is to blend these images together smoothly, which I do using the multi-resolution developed in Project 2. </p>
            <h3>Finding an Alpha Mask</h3>
            <p> In order to find the alpha mask for blending, I use a mask developed from scipy's distance_transform_edt (analogous to matlab's bwdist), which calculates a distance map from the center of an image. Points are defined to belong to one image if that image's distance_transform_edt is higher than the other image (i.e. the point in question is closer to the center of that image instead of the other image). </p>

            <p>There are several noticeable artifacts in the panorama, namely the table in the foreground being misaligned as well as the apparent feathered edges starting on the middle top and middle bottom of the panorama and extending to the right. The table's misalignment is probably due to the camera's position being shifted as it was being rotated to take the panorama; this effect is exacerbated for closer objects, and this misalignment is not noticeable for the rest of the image that is further away. The apparent feathered edges are due to multi-resolution blending of the merged (center + right) of the image with 0 (as the alpha mask is only the combined image) To fix this, we could do multi-resolution blending with 2 different masks to take into account the empty space, although it takes considerably more computation time for a relatively minor effect. </p>

            <p>There are some artifacts along the top of the image due to reflections from the glass I took the picture behind as well as the top of the glass appearing in the upper right of the panorama. Otherwise, the alignment and blending for this panorama went quite well. </p>
